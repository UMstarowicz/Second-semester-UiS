Assessment of the coding standards was done with pylint. Each code was scored and analyzed by the module.
Assessment was done considering three coding standards: code readability and documentation, code formatting and style, and naming conventions.

Gitlab 1:

https://github.com/SaiPieGiera/MOD550/blob/c2ae13a98226abd6949ce557f68cc7972cf07e14/code/exercise_1.py

I. Code Readability and Documentation
    - The module lacks a module-level docstring (C0114), which should describe the scriptâ€™s purpose.
    - Several functions (exercise_1.py:16:4, exercise_1.py:22:4, exercise_1.py:30:4) are missing function/method docstrings.

II. Code Formatting and Style
    - There are multiple instances of trailing whitespace (lines 30, 33, 36, 40, 63, etc.), which reduces readability and should be removed.
    - Two lines exceed the 100-character limit (lines 50 and 126).

III. Naming Conventions
    - Incorrect constant naming.

Gitlab 2:

https://github.com/dladea/MOD550/blob/03e35181e0b8de400ae30b98c7e1e6f707786473/code/exercise_1.py

I. Code Readability and Documentation
    - The script lacks a module-level docstring.

II. Code Formatting and Style
    - Missing final newline.
    - Multiple lines exceed the 100-character limit (lines 65, 129, 154).

III. Naming Conventions
    - Any issue was found.

Gitlab 3: 

https://github.com/svetaandrusenko/MOD550_Andrusenko/blob/220767e34ee333073256e89894c93c75fe54a6f6/MOD550/code/exercise_1.py

I. Code Readability and Documentation
    - TA function (line 22) lacks a docstring.

II. Code Formatting and Style
    - Whitespace is present at lines 35 and 59.
    - Lines 32 (107/100) and 63 (196/100) exceed the 100-character limit.
    - Missing final newline.

III. Naming Conventions
    - "header" (line 54) should be in UPPER_CASE to indicate it is a constant.
